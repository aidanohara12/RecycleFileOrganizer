# RecycleFileOrganizer
The goal of this project was to make marking file edits easy after they have had their hardware erased. This makes it easy to put your initials and the date erased in the correct point in the csv file.

All of this was done to help speed up the efficency of the company Aptitude's task of making a spreadsheet of all old devices that need to be recycled by streamlining the work all in one simple interface for the user.

The Java code can be found in repairFile.java and the actual csv file can be found in 20232024RecycleList.csv
